\subsection{Limitations}
As it is now the assignment present some limitations, as an example there aren't any query to the Postgres database, even if the route are setted up is setted up. 
The solution should be extensible as possible as the structure is simplier as possible, but can be improved in the future, also is implemented but not actually wokring an adapter for the query, inspired by this paper \cite{Liao2016}
this can be a really big improvement to make also simplier to add new databases in the future.

\subsection{Division of Work}
Riccardo mostly worked on the front-end part,the structure of the Sql database, and data analysis. Francesco mostly on the back-end part, the structure of github repositories and mongodb database.

\subsection{Extra Information}
In github repository you can find more than 2 accounts that contributed to the various repository, Popper002 and Riccardo Oro are the same person, and in the same way Edmi6163 and Francesco Mauro are the same person, just one is the Github account and one is the Git account. 
Instead, Eleonora Valeri (eleonora2305) started to contribute with us to the project but due to medical problems she was not able to continue to work with us.
Then, to avoid compatibility issues between os and architcture, we decide to set up mongodb on docker, there is a script to buil and run the container in the repository.
